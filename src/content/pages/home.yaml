      #### Welcome to the UMD Drone Club!

      We are a Student-led organization focused on drones, offering a place for students to design, build, and fly (or drive) unmanned systems.

      All members of the UMD community, including undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, and staff are welcome in our club!
      **You do not need to be an engineer to join.** 

      We consist of individual, independent, subteams. Each subteam chooses their own project, has its own leadership, and hosts their own build meetings.

      Through participating in our project lifecycle, students can gain experience in CAD software design, electronics deisgn, programming, and advanced manufacturing.

      We were founded in October 2025.

      If you would like to learn more, you can contact us via Discord, Instagram, or Terplink, the links to which can be found [here](/join)
