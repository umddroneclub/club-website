      Drone Club is a student-led organization at the University of Maryland dedicated to the science and operation of unmanned vehicles.

      That includes aerial, aquatic, and ground vehicles.

      We operate on a decentralized subteam structure, where indivdual projects are planned and executed by smaller focus subteams, and the club as a whole exists to do advertising, find funding, and manage university relations.
